### Foundational Security Concepts

- **Cryptographic Algorithm Groupings**
    - Cryptographic algorithms and protocols are grouped into four main areas:
        - **Symmetric encryption:** Conceals data blocks/streams of any size (messages, files, keys, passwords).
        - **Asymmetric encryption:** Conceals small data blocks (encryption keys, hash values) used in digital signatures.
        - **Data integrity algorithms:** Protects data blocks (messages) from alteration.
        - **Authentication protocols:** Schemes based on cryptographic algorithms to authenticate entity identities.
- **Network and Computer Security**
    - Network and Internet security involves measures to deter, prevent, detect, and correct security violations concerning information transmission.
    - **Computer security** is defined by NIST as "the protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources".
- **Computer Security Objectives (CIA Triad, Authenticity, Accountability)**
    - The core objectives form the **CIA Triad**:
        - **Confidentiality:** Protects private/confidential information from unauthorized disclosure. This includes **Data confidentiality** (information not disclosed) and **Privacy** (individuals control information about them).
        - **Integrity:** Ensures information and programs are changed only in authorized ways. This includes **Data integrity** (information changed only as specified) and **System integrity** (system performs as intended, free from manipulation).
        - **Availability:** Assures systems work promptly and services are not denied to authorized users.
    - **Possible additional concepts**:
        - **Authenticity:** Verifies user identity and trusted source of input.
        - **Accountability:** Ensures actions of an entity can be uniquely traced to that entity.
- **Breach of Security Levels of Impact**
    - Impact levels are categorized as:
        - **High:** Severe or catastrophic adverse effect on operations, assets, or individuals.
        - **Moderate:** Serious adverse effect on operations, assets, or individuals.
        - **Low:** Limited adverse effect on operations, assets, or individuals.
- **Computer Security Challenges**
    - Security is complex and requires considering potential attacks, deciding where to use mechanisms, constant monitoring, and often involves more than a single algorithm/protocol. It is a "battle of wits," offers little perceived benefit until failure, and can impede efficient, user-friendly operation.

### OSI Security Architecture

- **Definitions: Security Attack, Mechanism, Service**
    - **Security attack:** Any action compromising an organization's information security.
    - **Security mechanism:** A process or device designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.
    - **Security service:** A processing or communication service enhancing system/data transfer security, intended to counter attacks using security mechanisms.
- **Security Attacks**
    - Classified into **passive attacks** and **active attacks**.
    - **Passive Attacks:** Attempt to learn from the system without altering resources; involve eavesdropping or monitoring.
        - **Release of message contents:** Opponent obtains transmitted information.
        - **Traffic analysis:** Monitoring transmissions to gather information.
    - **Active Attacks:** Attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation, difficult to prevent due to vulnerabilities; goal is detection and recovery.
        - **Masquerade:** One entity pretends to be another.
        - **Replay:** Capturing and retransmitting data units to produce unauthorized effects.
        - **Modification of messages:** Altering part of a legitimate message, delaying, or reordering it for unauthorized effects.
        - **Denial of service:** Prevents or inhibits normal use of communication facilities.
- **Security Services (X.800 Categories)**
    - X.800 defines specific services:
        - **Authentication:** Assures communication is authentic, verifying sender identity for messages or entities in ongoing interactions.
            - Includes Peer entity authentication and Data origin authentication.
        - **Access control:** Limits and controls access to systems/applications via communication links, requiring identification/authentication to tailor access rights.
        - **Data confidentiality:** Protects transmitted data from passive attacks, ranging from all user data to specific fields, and traffic flow analysis.
        - **Data integrity:** Applies to streams of messages or individual messages.
            - **Connection-oriented integrity service:** Assures messages in a stream are received as sent (no duplication, insertion, modification, reordering, replay).
            - **Connectionless integrity service:** Protects individual messages, primarily against modification.
        - **Nonrepudiation:** Prevents sender or receiver from denying a transmitted message, allowing proof of sending or receiving.
- **Security Mechanisms (X.800)**
    - **Specific Security Mechanisms:** Encipherment, Digital signatures, Access controls, Data integrity, Authentication exchange, Traffic padding, Routing control, Notarization.
    - **Pervasive Security Mechanisms:** Trusted functionality, Security labels, Event detection, Security audit trails, Security recovery.

### Network Access Security Model

- **Unwanted Access**
    - Involves placing logic in a computer system that exploits vulnerabilities, affecting application and utility programs.
    - Programs can pose two types of threats:
        - **Information access threats:** Intercept or modify data for unauthorized users.
        - **Service threats:** Exploit service flaws to inhibit legitimate user access.
