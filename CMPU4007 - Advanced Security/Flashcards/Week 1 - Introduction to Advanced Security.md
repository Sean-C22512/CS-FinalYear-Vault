Q: What is symmetric encryption used for? #flashcard 
A: Used to conceal contents of blocks or streams of data of any size (messages, files, encryption keys, passwords).
<!--ID: 1757946336438-->


Q: What is asymmetric encryption used for? #flashcard 
A: Used to conceal small blocks of data (encryption keys, hash function values) used in digital signatures.
<!--ID: 1757946336444-->


Q: What are data integrity algorithms used for? #flashcard 
A: Used to protect blocks of data (messages) from alteration.
<!--ID: 1757946336445-->


Q: What are authentication protocols? #flashcard 
A: Schemes based on cryptographic algorithms designed to authenticate the identity of entities.
<!--ID: 1757946336447-->


Q: According to NIST, computer security is {{c1::the protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources}}. #flashcard 
A: This includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications.
<!--ID: 1757946398309-->


Q: What does data confidentiality assure? #flashcard 
A: Assures private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
<!--ID: 1757946398315-->


Q: What does privacy assure? #flashcard 
A: Assures individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.
<!--ID: 1757946398321-->


Q: What does data integrity assure? #flashcard 
A: Assures information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner.
<!--ID: 1757946398326-->


Q: What does system integrity assure? #flashcard 
A: Assures a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation.
<!--ID: 1757946398330-->


Q: What does availability assure? #flashcard 
A: Assures systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users.
<!--ID: 1757946398334-->


Q: What is authenticity? #flashcard 
A: Verifying that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source.
<!--ID: 1757946398339-->


Q: What is accountability in security? #flashcard 
A: Security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity.
<!--ID: 1757946398342-->


Q: What is a security attack? #flashcard 
A: Any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization.
<!--ID: 1757946398344-->


Q: What is a security mechanism? #flashcard 
A: A process (or device) designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.
<!--ID: 1757946398347-->


Q: What is a security service? #flashcard 
A: A processing or communication service that enhances the security of data processing systems and information transfers, intended to counter security attacks using one or more security mechanisms.
<!--ID: 1757946398353-->


Q: What is a passive attack? #flashcard 
A: Attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources.
<!--ID: 1757946398358-->


Q: What is an active attack? #flashcard 
A: Attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation.
<!--ID: 1757946398361-->


Q: What is "release of message contents"? #flashcard 
A: A type of passive attack where the opponent obtains information being transmitted.
<!--ID: 1757946398364-->


Q: What is traffic analysis? #flashcard 
A: A type of passive attack involving eavesdropping or monitoring transmissions to obtain information.
<!--ID: 1757946398369-->


Q: What is masquerade? #flashcard 
A: An active attack where one entity pretends to be a different entity.
<!--ID: 1757946398375-->


Q: What is a replay attack? #flashcard 
A: An active attack involving passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retransmission to produce an unauthorized effect.
<!--ID: 1757946398380-->


Q: What is "modification of messages"? #flashcard 
A: An active attack where a portion of a legitimate message is altered, or messages are delayed/reordered to produce an unauthorized effect.
<!--ID: 1757946398384-->


Q: What is denial of service? #flashcard 
A: An active attack that prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of communications facilities.
<!--ID: 1757946398390-->


Q: What does the authentication service assure? #flashcard 
A: Assuring that a communication is authentic; for a single message, assures recipient of source; for ongoing interaction, assures authenticity of entities and prevents masquerade.
<!--ID: 1757946398398-->


Q: What is access control? #flashcard 
A: Ability to limit and control access to host systems and applications via communications links, requiring identification/authentication to tailor access rights.
<!--ID: 1757946398405-->


Q: What does data confidentiality service provide? #flashcard 
A: Protection of transmitted data from passive attacks, can be broad (all user data) or narrow (single message/fields), includes protection of traffic flow from analysis.
<!--ID: 1757946398411-->


Q: What is connection-oriented integrity service? #flashcard 
A: Assures messages in a stream are received as sent with no duplication, insertion, modification, reordering, or replays.
<!--ID: 1757946398416-->


Q: What is connectionless integrity service? #flashcard 
A: Deals with individual messages, generally provides protection against message modification only.
<!--ID: 1757946398422-->


Q: What is nonrepudiation? #flashcard 
A: Prevents either sender or receiver from denying a transmitted message; sender can prove receipt, receiver can prove sending.
<!--ID: 1757946398426-->


Q: What are information access threats? #flashcard 
A: Exploits vulnerabilities to intercept or modify data on behalf of unauthorized users.
<!--ID: 1757946398429-->


Q: What are service threats? #flashcard 
A: Exploits service flaws to inhibit use by legitimate users.
<!--ID: 1757946398432-->
