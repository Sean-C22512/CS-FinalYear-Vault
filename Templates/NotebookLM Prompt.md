Use this prompt when processing a lecture PDF in NotebookLM. The goal is to create clean, exam-focused notes that are ready for Obsidian.

**Prompt:**  
"Please take the following lecture material and:

1. Summarise the content into clear, structured headings (like H2/H3).
    
2. Extract key definitions, formulas, and algorithms in bullet point form.
    
3. Highlight common pitfalls / misconceptions students often make.
    
4. Suggest possible exam-style questions **by cross-referencing the uploaded past exam PDFs (if available)**. If no exam papers are provided, skip this step.
    
5. Keep the writing concise and consistent with academic style, but not overly verbose.
    
6. Do NOT invent extra material â€” only use the uploaded lecture and exam PDFs."
