Binary classification is a type of supervised learning where the model predicts one of two possible classes for a given input. #flashcard

What is the purpose of the sigmoid function in logistic regression?
To map the predicted values to a probability between 0 and 1. #flashcard

What is overfitting in machine learning?
When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, reducing its ability to generalize to new data. #flashcard

What is the formula for the sigmoid function?
Ïƒ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) #flashcard

The cross-entropy loss is commonly used as a loss function for binary classification tasks. #flashcard

What is the decision boundary in logistic regression?
The line or surface where the predicted probability equals 0.5, separating the two classes. #flashcard

Explain the difference between precision and recall.
Precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among actual positives. #flashcard

Given a dataset with severe class imbalance, what strategy would you use to improve model performance?
Options include resampling (oversampling minority, undersampling majority), using weighted loss functions, or selecting appropriate evaluation metrics like F1-score. #flashcard
