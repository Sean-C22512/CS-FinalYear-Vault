## ðŸ“˜ Summary


**Families of Machine Learning Algorithms (Course Overview):**

1. Information based learning
2. Similarity based learning
3. Probability based learning
4. Error based learning
5. Deep learning

## The Predictive Data Analytics Project Lifecycle: CRISP-DM

The **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** process outlines six key phases in a predictive data analytics project:

1. **Business Understanding**
2. **Data Understanding**
3. **Data Preparation**
4. **Modeling**
5. **Evaluation**
6. **Deployment**

## ðŸŽ¯ Possible Exam-Style Questions

- **Explain why machine learning is often described as an ill-posed problem and give an example.** (This question was asked in the 2023/24 exam)
- **What is the inductive bias of a machine learning algorithm? Give an example.** (This question was asked in the 2023/24 exam)
- **Explain on an example what can go wrong when a machine learning classifier uses the wrong inductive bias.** (This question was asked in the 2023/24 exam)
- **Explain what overfitting is in machine learning. Provide an example to illustrate.** (This question was asked in the 2024/25 exam, similar to the 2023/24 question on wrong inductive bias)
- **What is the difference between restriction bias and preference bias? Give an example of each.** (This question was asked in the 2024/25 exam)
- **Define Predictive Data Analytics and provide examples of its applications.**
- **Explain the concept of a consistent prediction model and its implications for generalisation.**
- **Briefly outline the key phases of the CRISP-DM process.**
