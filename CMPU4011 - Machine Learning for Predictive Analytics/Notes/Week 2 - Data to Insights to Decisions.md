## Week: 2  
Module: CMPU 4011 - Predictive Data Analytics  
Topic: Data to Insights to Decisions  
Tags: #lecture #week2 #cmpu4011  
Linked Exam Qs: [[Exams/2022 Exam QX]] (add later)

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

This lecture introduces the **early phases of the CRISP-DM process**â€”Business Understanding, Data Understanding, and parts of Data Preparation. It focuses on how to translate business problems into analytics solutions, assess feasibility, and design the **Analytics Base Table (ABT)** for predictive modeling. Key considerations include feature design, handling time in modeling, and compliance with legal frameworks such as data protection.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts & Definitions

- **CRISP-DM Phases** â†’ Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation.
    
- **Business Problem Translation** â†’ Identifying business goals, operations, and how predictive analytics can provide value.
    
- **Assessing Feasibility** â†’ Two checks: (1) Is the data available? (2) Can the business use the insights?
    
- **Analytics Base Table (ABT)** â†’ Structured dataset with one-row-per-prediction-subject, containing descriptive features + target feature.
    
- **Prediction Subject** â†’ The unit of analysis; each row represents one subject (e.g., a claim in insurance fraud prediction).
    
- **Features** â†’ Variables used in modeling.
    
    - **Raw Features** â†’ Directly from source data.
        
    - **Derived Features** â†’ Created via transformations (aggregates, ratios, flags, mappings).
        
- **Data Types** â†’ Numeric, Binary, Ordinal, Interval, Categorical, Textual.
    
- **Temporal Modeling** â†’
    
    - **Observation Period** â†’ Time before event; used to capture descriptive behavior.
        
    - **Outcome Period** â†’ Time after event; reveals if target outcome occurs.
        
- **Legal Constraints** â†’ Anti-discrimination and data protection laws influence feature selection and ABT design.
    
    - **Collection Limitation Principle** â†’ Only collect necessary data.
        
    - **Purpose Specification Principle** â†’ Use data only for stated purposes.
        
    - **Use Limitation Principle** â†’ Restrict further use of data outside intended scope.

## ðŸŽ¯ Possible Exam-Style Questions

- Explain the process of **Assessing Feasibility** for a predictive analytics solution. What two key questions must be addressed?
    
- Describe the structure and purpose of the **Analytics Base Table (ABT)**. Why is the prediction subject and the "one-row-per-subject" rule important?
    
- Differentiate between **raw features** and **derived features**. Give four examples of derived feature types.
    
- Define the **observation period** and **outcome period** in propensity modeling. Illustrate with an insurance fraud claim scenario.
    
- Discuss how **Data Protection Legislation** influences ABT design, referencing three key principles.
