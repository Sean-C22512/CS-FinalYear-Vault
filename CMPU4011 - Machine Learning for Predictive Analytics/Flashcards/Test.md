TARGET DECK: CMPU4011 - Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics

Binary classification #flashcard
is a type of supervised learning where the model predicts one of two possible classes for a given input.
<!--ID: 1757867474512-->


What is the purpose of the sigmoid function in logistic regression? #flashcard
To map the predicted values to a probability between 0 and 1.
<!--ID: 1757867474518-->


What is overfitting in machine learning? #flashcard
When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, reducing its ability to generalize to new data.
<!--ID: 1757867474519-->


What is the formula for the sigmoid function? #flashcard
Ïƒ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
<!--ID: 1757867474521-->


The cross-entropy loss #flashcard
is commonly used as a loss function for binary classification tasks.
<!--ID: 1757867474522-->


What is the decision boundary in logistic regression? #flashcard
The line or surface where the predicted probability equals 0.5, separating the two classes.
<!--ID: 1757867474524-->


Explain the difference between precision and recall. #flashcard
Precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among actual positives.
<!--ID: 1757867474525-->


Given a dataset with severe class imbalance, what strategy would you use to improve model performance? #flashcard
Options include resampling (oversampling minority, undersampling majority), using weighted loss functions, or selecting appropriate evaluation metrics like F1-score.
