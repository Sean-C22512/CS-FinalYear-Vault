## Concept Cards
Q: What is binary classification?
A: A type of supervised learning where the model predicts one of two possible classes for a given input.

Q: What is the purpose of the sigmoid function in logistic regression?
A: To map the predicted values to a probability between 0 and 1.

Q: What is overfitting in machine learning?
A: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, reducing its ability to generalize to new data.

## Formula / Algorithm Cards
Q: What is the formula for the sigmoid function?
A: Ïƒ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

Cloze: The {{c1::cross-entropy loss}} is commonly used as a loss function for {{c2::binary classification}} tasks.

Q: What is the decision boundary in logistic regression?
A: The line or surface where the predicted probability equals 0.5, separating the two classes.

## Exam-Style Cards
Q: Explain the difference between precision and recall.
A: Precision measures the proportion of true positives among predicted positives. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among actual positives.

Q: Given a dataset with severe class imbalance, what strategy would you use to improve model performance?
A: Options include resampling (oversampling minority, undersampling majority), using weighted loss functions, or selecting appropriate evaluation metrics like F1-score.
