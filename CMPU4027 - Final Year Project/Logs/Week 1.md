## **Concept 6: SecureVote – Blockchain-Based University Voting Platform**

**1. Project Title & Problem Statement**  
_Title:_ SecureVote: Transparent and Tamper-Proof University Elections  
_Problem:_ University elections often rely on insecure online polls or paper ballots, risking manipulation or lack of trust. A transparent, tamper-proof, and verifiable system is needed.

**2. System Description & Scope**  
A blockchain-backed web platform for student elections that ensures votes are anonymous, immutable, and auditable, while also being user-friendly for non-technical voters.

**3. Potential Technologies/Stack**

- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind for modern UI
    
- **Backend:** Node.js or Flask for API endpoints
    
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (private testnet), Solidity for smart contracts
    
- **Database:** MongoDB/Postgres for user/vote metadata
    
- **Cloud:** AWS EC2 for hosting, S3 for static assets
    

**4. Key Technical Deliverables (Features)**

- Blockchain-based smart contract for casting and recording votes.
    
- Secure authentication (student ID integration or OAuth).
    
- Real-time election dashboard with turnout and results.
    
- Tamper-proof audit trail and transparency reports.
    
- Role management (admin, voter, auditor).
    

**5. Complexity/Challenge Justification**

- Goes beyond a “polling app” by leveraging **blockchain immutability, cryptographic integrity, and decentralized trust**.
    
- Requires rigorous **requirements analysis (security, anonymity, reliability)** and formal testing of smart contracts.
    
- Challenges include **designing for scalability, usability, and auditability**
